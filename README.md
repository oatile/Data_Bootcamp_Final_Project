# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Oatile Ramsay in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others--including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof-- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

Project Description: 
This project will look at the effect of family household income levels on average SAT scores in New York State as the beginning to a larger question on educations role in addressing inequality. 

In my time at NYU, I have deveoped an interest in emerging markets and economic mobility. Essentially, what are some of the factors that would contribute to overall economic growth in a way that does isolate lower earning communities? The overall question of inclusive growth would be too grand for the scope of this project. Instead, I aim to identify the correlation between education and income inequality, and how it may affect economic mobility.
